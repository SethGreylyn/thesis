This project contains the source code and output for my Master's thesis, *Generators and Relations for the Group U<sub>4</sub>(Z[1/sqrt(2), i])*.

The thesis is a work of research mathematics, advancing the state of the art of group theory. Namely it gives a *presentation* of the group of four-by-four unitary matrices extended by the reciprocal of the square root of 2 and the imaginary unit *i*. The work here was motivated by the problem of *exact synthesis* in quantum computation, and provides an algebraic foundation for solving the problem in the limited case of four-by-four unitary matrices.

See the included PDF for the full thesis.
